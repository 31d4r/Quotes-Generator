# Quotes-Generator

This app was developed during quarantine because my mood was so wierd. Having ideas in the other hand no so this is something fast. I did this in like 20mins. Just to update git repo and make smile on my face.

Having no idea what's going to happen I decided to learn something about algorithms so as soon as possible I will update my git repos with Swift algo code.

Each time you start the app new quote is generated, dunno if btn is working. Feel free to support me. I am still student hah.
Down below you can see how app looks like.
